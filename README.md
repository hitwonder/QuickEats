- **Clean Architecture**: 
  - The app follows modern Android architecture principles, including MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), for maintainability and scalability.

- **Dependency Injection with Hilt**: 
  - The app is built with Hilt for dependency injection, enabling modular code and easier testing.

- **RecyclerView for Item Display**: 
  - Efficiently display large lists of products using RecyclerView, providing a smooth user experience.

- **CoordinatorLayout with Floating Action Button**:
